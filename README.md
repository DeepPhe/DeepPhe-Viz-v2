# DeepPhe-Viz-v2

And updated version of DeepPhe Viz that runs on the latest version of Node.js and the most up to date packages (with less performance and security issues).

Upgrading required using libraries that made confusing "breaking changes," so starting with a new repository made more sense than strugging through getting all of that working.

This current version on includes the CohortFilter but bringing the other Components over shouldn't be much work when the time comes.
